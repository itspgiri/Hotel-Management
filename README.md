## Overview
This project is designed to provide a basic offline software for assisting in the management of a hotel. The aim was to ease the process of managment of records by connecting Java NetBeans with MySQL.  The project uses structured, modular technique and menu oriented interface.

## Front End 
We used NetBeans IDE to bring a basic utility front end available for the user. It is easy to install and to be used by anyone since it's programmed in Java (Platform Intependent). Below are a few previews of the project when used to manage the records of a hotel.

## Conclusion
The project was made in 2017, and I have it on my GitHub since it was the first project I ever made. There are many new technology now available and there are many different ways to perform the above in a much efficient manner by using technologies such as Cloud. It is available as public repository as it's the first ever project I undertook and is a great idea for anyone who wishes to learn the basics of programming and DBMS.

The project was a huge learning step as it involved basic DBMS, Java Programming for one to understand the basic of developing something. It was developed with reference to documentation that were provided by NetBeans IDE and the knowledge of basic queries handling in DBMS.
